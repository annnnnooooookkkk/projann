<p><h2><span>What it means to be an Explorer: Rebecca Hale</span></h2></p>

<p><h2>Make a difference</h2></p>
<p>At the National Geographic Society, we believe that exploration starts with you. That means when you give, 100 percent of your tax-deductible contribution will go directly to our Explorers working across our five key focus areas. Your support enables Explorers to make important discoveries, pursue historic achievements, and push the boundaries of innovation to build a better future.</p>
<p><h2>Explorers are infinitely curious people who are passionate about our planet and making it a better place.</h2>In the depths of the ocean, Explorers reveal underwater worlds that sustain life on Earth. In subterranean caves, they investigate our ancient past and the very roots of humanity. At the edge of extinction, they courageously work to end wildlife trafficking and protect species at risk. On the frontlines of conservation, they help safeguard fragile ecosystems for future generations. They are driving cutting-edge technology and pushing the limits of what is possible.</p>
<p><h2>The Explorer Code</h2></p>
<p>The Explorer Code is a simple credo that fosters a productive, collaborative, empathetic, and solution-oriented National Geographic Explorers community. Our Explorers are expected to exemplify this code, demonstrating integrity and acting according to the highest ethical standards.</p>
<ol>
    <li>treat their peers, National Geographic staff, and others with respect</li>
    <li>present and share their work openly, truthfully, and accurately</li>
    <li>collaborate willingly with and support other members of the community</li>
    <li>set an example for and mentor other members of the community</li>
</ol>

<p>Well over a century after our founding, National Geographic continues to reach and resonate with millions of people worldwide. How has our organization stood the test of time? We’ve stayed true to our original mission to pursue and celebrate exploration, scientific excellence, education, and unforgettable storytelling while simultaneously evolving with nimbleness and fortitude in a rapidly changing world. We embraced innovation and intentionally adapted, thoughtfully expanding our business model, global reach, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. In doing so, we have remained a vibrant, relevant, world-class brand at the forefront of exploration and knowledge.</p> 
<p>NG Next celebrates our legendary legacy and takes the next step forward by charting a dynamic, five-year plan that strengthens our foundation, builds on our momentum, embeds diversity, equity, and inclusion into every aspect of our work, and sets a clear vision for the future to drive significant impact.</p>
<p><h2>Our joint-venture partnership enables us to invest every philanthropic dollar — 100 percent of donations — directly to our Explorers and mission programs.</h2>One of the powerful ways we build on our legacy and accelerate our impact work is through an innovative, sustainable business model. This joint-venture enterprise combines National Geographic’s global television channels, publications, media, and products and allows us to return a portion of the proceeds from these assets to fund our non-profit work. Disney is one of the most recognized brands in the world and shares our legacy of innovation, inspiration, and storytelling. With its business expertise, brand power, and global footprint, Disney has the unique ability to broadcast the Society’s mission to millions more people who are endlessly curious and share our passion for exploration.</p>
<p><h2>Our past and future</h2>We have had the privilege of framing the world for generations of people all across the globe. We recognize that privilege bears with it a significant responsibility to treat every community’s story with respect, dignity, and cultural sensitivity. We are committed to telling our own organization’s story, which requires recognizing that the Society has not always valued everyone’s stories equally, nor have we always treated all communities with which we have interacted and engaged with respect, dignity, and sensitivity. Taking ownership of our own complex story requires facing our history of colonialism, racism, sexism, and other forms of systemic oppression. We recognize a history that placed limits on who became members of the original Society, who became Explorers, who told stories, whose stories were told, and who was able to join our talented team of staff. For much of its history, the Society adhered to an approach of exploration and discovery that focused on opening the wonders of the world to its members without also recognizing the local communities, societies, and intrepid adventurers who paved the way to those wonders of the world long before the arrival of National Geographic Explorers. These parts of our own history are incredibly painful, but we recognize that fully accepting and acknowledging the mistakes of our past allows us to build our diverse, inclusive, and equitable future. Your story matters. We are not all the same. It is our differences that make the National Geographic Society, and our world, a better place. We embrace each person’s identity, experiences, and abilities, and we commit to cultivating an environment where everyone benefits from opportunity, mutual respect and a sense of belonging. We all have a story to tell. When we share and celebrate our stories, the yellow border comes to life.</p>
